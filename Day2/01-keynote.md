# Keynote presentations
## Opening presentation
**Presenter:** Barry Crist, CEO of Chef.


 * Enterprise Paradox: 90% have identified Automation, DevOps, and agile practices as critical to the business, yet <15% have done so.
 * Digital transformation: going from infra-centric to app-centric; Enterprise to FAANG (Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix Google).
 * Method: Act like a Digital Native.
   + A customer shouldn't be able to tell if you were a digital company or a "traditional" company.


### IT: Acting like a Digital Native
 * Bring organizational confidence.


### Digital Natives:
 * Deliver effortless infrastructure to app teams w/ automation (immediate, scalable, secure).
 * Ruthlessly eliminate all velocity obstacles.
   + Compliance is a velocity problem.
   + Solve compliance tool fatigue by shifting left.
 * One way to build, deploy, and manage all applications.
   + Biggest divide between FAANG vs the Enterprise.
   + Enterprise stumbling blocks:
     - COTS (**C**ommercial **O**ff **T**he **S**helf software)
     - Legacy
   + One path vs. a thousand paths.


### Chef Software's Ambition
 * Our platform is the single way to build, deploy, and manage all software in all environments.
 * Legacy, COTS, Containers, Kubernetes---all of it.
